<p>With more than a decade of working as a software developer, I started to see a
shift in the on-boarding. I come in an organization with previous experiences,
bias and preferences. No longer a clean slate, it takes more effort for me to
buy in the organization's culture. I want to break down the on-boarding process.
What works and what does not, and how I can minimize the friction.</p>
<p>Much of my opinions complement what was written in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">On being a senior engineer</a> and
highly recommend reading the article.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-does-work-mean-to-me">
<h2>What does work mean to me?</h2>
<p>Work is something I find joy in doing. It is the team spirit and the
accomplishments that gets me out of bed looking forward to challenges ahead. And
being in the market this long, the tech and titles mean little to me. Coding is
the primary responsibility in all the positions I undertook but it does not
define my full worth as a developer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="professional-on-boarding">
<h2>Professional on-boarding</h2>
<p>Starting from scratch is challenging. I don't know how things work and thoughts
of inadequacy pop up every now and then. It starts the same way every time,
There's a laptop with a stock setup waiting for me and next to it a letter on
how to setup my access to email, vpn and private git repositories and issue
tracker. Once I have access to my email, a welcome message and 1 or 2 requests
for appointments are waiting for me. I get to meet the team lead, project
manager or director and they give me a broad overview of the project. In
average, I'm given 3 for 4 hours of "training". Once that is done, I'm no closer
to understanding the architecture and the state of the project.</p>
<p>The first step is to familiarize myself with the development life-cycle and
introducing myself to the key players. It is here where I encounter the first
mine field. The project can either be missing tests, documentation, deployment
playbook or reproducible development setup. My first reaction is to fix these
"issues" before starting any form of development, but experience has taught me
that that path is dangerous. "Fixing" problems that I only "see" can come across
as arrogant and not a good way to win friends.</p>
<p>I learned that the best thing to do is document everything in a journal. I break
it down:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Objective (what do I want to do)</li>
<li>Method (How I go about doing it)</li>
<li>Results (Is the outcome what I wanted)</li>
<li>Feedback or summary (Did I learn something)</li>
</ol>
<p>The notes provides a comprehensive reference of my thought process. With my
journal as my guide, I could build a strategy of improving the process the next
time. The key is to record every process even if it is the nth time I'm doing
it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cultural-on-boarding">
<h2>Cultural on-boarding</h2>
<p>The role I have in an organization is important to me. It is more important than
the technology used or the project I'm assigned to. I started to see how
mentoring was the most satisfying part of my day. I'm a people person; I'm a
team player. Being a leader involves a mastery of risk taking and I was still
uncomfortable taking. But one thing is for sure, I don't want to be stuck in a
cubical, coding all day.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway's law</a> influences
on-boarding. It is expected that the senior(s) will have a active role in
mentoring and knowledge sharing, but it is conditional to the communications
channels available.</p>
<blockquote>
organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs
which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.</blockquote>

<td>The work is very dynamic and volatile, output is prioritized over quality
and unorthodox approaches are encouraged. What you expect from a
start-up. The on-boarding should promote leadership, and encourage tech
lunches and short iterative feedback cycles to help build the platform
the new hire starts of from.</td>
<td>The position is more of a specialist. The development direction is more
focused and shift in development is not as radical. The on-boarding
should promote an academic environment by having presentations or
workshops on.</td>

<tr>
<th class="stub">Mature organization</th>
<td>The challenges much like the start-up, are the same but the team can be
confronted with conflicting cultures. The willpower of the management
team is the difference maker. A prepared on-boarding checklist outlining
the relationship between the team and the organization.</td>
<td>The team is mature with entrenched values. Therefore, the development
norms and rules are extensive and explicit. The on-boarding</td>
