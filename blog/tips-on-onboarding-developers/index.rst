.. description: Tips to improve the on-boarding developers

Working in many different companies, I can define the on-boarding process as an
awkward first date. Trying to feel out what I need to do and what is expected.
These are the tips to help senior developers and management build a constructive
relationship.

Hiring management prepare to integrate a developer into the team
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This goes beyond getting the desk and laptop ready. The hiring *team* needs to
have a game plan how integrate the new hire. Manage expectations of the team and
set a responsible(s) to mentor the new hire through the first few months.

I don't understand the position some companies take during the hiring process.
The strategy of secrecy towards the new hire does not help anyone. Having a
road-map available and accessible to the new hire is a good practice. It takes
out the guess work and transparent. A road-map should have a deadlines,
milestones, project kick-offs. I find this important because it give me a feel
of the rhythm of the team.

Summary:

* Write a game plan to integrate a new hire
* Brief the team of the new hire. Explain why he/she is hired.
* Manage team expectations, define what the responsibilities are.
* Assign mentor(s) to the new hire.
* Have a road-map available as a source of reference.

As a new hire, every role you start is unique. And it requires professionalism.
This blog post is pure gold: `On being a senior engineer
<https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/>`_. I highly
recommend reading it.

Points in the blog post I emphasize on in the early stages are:

* "Mature engineers seek out constructive criticism of their designs."
* "Mature engineers understand the non-technical areas of how they are perceived."
* "Mature engineers understand that not all of their projects are filled with
  rockstar-on-stage work."
* "Mature engineers make their trade-offs explicit when making judgments and
  decisions."
* "Mature engineers are empathetic."

Hope this helps you get into the right mind-frame for your next position.

Happy coding
