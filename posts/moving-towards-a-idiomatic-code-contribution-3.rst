Step 3. Develop your communication skills
================================================

This step is probably the hardest to explain.

1. English is the defacto language of most projects. If you are not fluent in
   English, try:

   1. Go straight to the point,
   2. ...

2. Stick to the facts. Most common example is when someone declares that they
   found a bug. Do you have a test case to prove it? Is it already declared?

3. Learn to navigate the communication channels. Openstack is probably the most
   complex example I have seen.
