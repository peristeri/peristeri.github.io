With more than a decade of working as a software developer, I started to see a
shift in the interview process and the onboarding. It begins with the interview
process and continues into the 3 first months of employment. I want to explore
this process through the eyes of a veteran developer.

   The next level on interviewing

.. TEASER_END

How am I?
---------

I got a bachelors degree in computer science in the early 2000's. Agile, Kanban,
unit testing and SCRUM were not part of the curriculum. I'm self taught and it
interested me enough to follow a masters in software maintenance. I lean towards
processes that support a predictable and reproducible development life-cycle.

General vs. Specialty
---------------------

I'm interested in the software process and never really interested in any
specific domain. I have an academic interest in data and the impact it has in
decision making. What stresses me is the mathematics involved. Helping
mathematicians implement solutions reinforced my theory that I need to improve
my math skills.


Team player vs. mentor vs. senior developer
-------------------------------------------

Knowing what role I want to play in an organization is important to me. It is
more important than the technology used or the project I'm assigned to. I
started to see how mentoring was the most satisfying part of my day. I'm a
people person; I'm a team player. Being a leader involves a mastery of risk
taking and I was still uncomfortable taking. But one thing is for sure, I don't
want to be stuck in a cubical, coding all day.

Team maturity, culture and Conway's Law
---------------------------------------

`Conway's law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law>`_ is an observation
that I'm skeptical but is consistently accurate.

Positions open up for one of two reasons: the position exists and you are
replacing someone. Or the team is growing and you are part of that growth. In
addition, the onboarding process can wither be well layed out plan or something
bootstrapped.

And this will affect the resources available the trajectory of the onboarding.

Anatomy of the ideal company
============================

Position dissidence
-------------------

What you are hired is not what you are assigned to work on. It is common and can
derail your onboarding. In hindsight, I emphasized more on the requirements
found in the job position and never clarifying the position's .

What does work mean to you?

And finally, what is the culture of the team? What is the team dynamics? It is
